        <p>The purpose of this study is to collect data on how children with high-functioning autism express emotions to
            create a computer system that can identify emotions from children with high-functioning autism using video,
            audio and heart rate records. Today, because children with autism express emotions differently than the
            neurotypical population, emotion identification technology does not work well for them.</p>
        <p>Emotions of children with ASD are very important. Their emotional state usually determines how willing and
            ready they are to learn and to interact with the world around them. When the child is anxious or agitated,
            it is harder for them to learn or process instructions. When the child is calm, it is easier to guide them
            to learn and/or engage in social interactions. Having an Emotion Detection systems specifically for children
            with ASD can bring a benefit when using a computer program as part of the intervention treatment for ASD,
            for example, when using a game that teaches children with high-functioning ASD how to start a conversation
            in a school cafeteria. If the game identifies that the child is anxious, agitated or angry, it would
            automatically present a calming activity to relax the child, so they would be in a state of calming
            readiness to learn again and to continue engaging with a tool that is a treatment for them.
            Also, creating an emotion identification computer system that works well for children with autism will
            increase inclusion for them because they will be able to use a technology that also works well for them.

        <h3>THE RESEARCH - Summary</h3>
        <p> If you and your child agree to take part in this study, they will be asked to do some activities that will
            trigger emotions responses from them (for example, happiness, excitement, anxiety) while they will be
            audio/video/heart rate recorded. This will take around 30 minutes for each session.</p>
        <p>
            If you and your child agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to attend sessions to watch the
            recorded video of your child’s session while indicates which emotion they are engaged with. You and your
            child will be required to attend 3 different sessions. The sessions will be scheduled to best suit yours and
            your child’s available time. </p>
        <p>
            Since the study involves evoking emotions from your child, we foresee possible risk of your child to become
            emotionally agitated or feel emotional stress. But we have put several measures in place to minimise this
            risk and to help your child to regulate their emotions during the study. One example is the presence of a
            therapist specialised in ASD during the whole time to provide any needed support.</p>
        <p>
            The information gathered will be treated with privacy and anonymity. No information regarding your child
            will be revealed in this research. Information will be stored safely with access only available to the
            research team listed above and it will be destroyed after 3 years. The anonymised results from the study
            will be included in a thesis and may be published and discussed at academic conferences or in journals.</p>
        <p>
            Your child doesn’t have to take part in this study if you/they don’t want to and you/they can withdraw from
            the study at any time, without saying why. If you have any questions or if anything is unclear just ask me,
            I am happy to discuss the study with you.</p>

        <p>
            Finally, thank you for taking the time to read this, and please also read the complete <a href="/information">Information page</a> with
            more details on this research.
