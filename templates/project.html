            <p>Personal-independent Emotion Detection Model for Children with High-Functioning ASD</p>

        <!--        <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="../static/images/pic11.jpg" alt=""/></a>-->
        <p>The purpose of this study is to collect data on how children with high-functioning autism express emotions to
            create a computer system that can identify emotions from children with high-functioning autism using video,
            audio and heart rate records. Today, because children with autism express emotions differently than the
            neurotypical population, emotion identification technology does not work well for them.</p>
        <p>Emotions of children with ASD are very important. Their emotional state usually determines how willing and
            ready they are to learn and to interact with the world around them. When the child is anxious or agitated,
            it is harder for them to learn or process instructions. When the child is calm, it is easier to guide them
            to learn and/or engage in social interactions. Having an Emotion Detection systems specifically for children
            with ASD can bring a benefit when using a computer program as part of the intervention treatment for ASD,
            for example, when using a game that teaches children with high-functioning ASD how to start a conversation
            in a school cafeteria. If the game identifies that the child is anxious, agitated or angry, it would
            automatically present a calming activity to relax the child, so they would be in a state of calming
            readiness to learn again and to continue engaging with a tool that is a treatment for them.
            Also, creating an emotion identification computer system that works well for children with autism will
            increase inclusion for them because they will be able to use a technology that also works well for them.
